This is a small app for a school project. It's purpose is to connect to a device (prototype) which vibrates in intervalls. The user is supposed to click a button if he is feeling productive or ignore the button if he isn't. Then the app can show statistics for the users productivity. The solution is for those who want to monitor their productivity, as well as having a device for reminding you to stay productive by vibrating in a manualy set interval.

## How to run this App

Install Ionic CLI
```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```
Then to run it, cd into the `ProbandLatest` folder
